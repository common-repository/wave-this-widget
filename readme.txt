A sidebar widget that adds a button to posts that lets readers share it in Google Wave. Uses the exerpt of the page or creates one.

== Description ==

The Google Wave "Wave This" function takes the title of a post and a short description and starts a new wave for you to add users to.

This sidebar widget adds a button to individual post pages that sends the post title and exerpt to Wave. If you haven't set an exerpt the widget uses the default one generated by Wordpress for each post. The default button is 300px wide to allow for larger sidebars. Please resize the button using the widget options.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Unzip and upload the entire `wave-this-widget` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Drag the "Wave This!" widget onto your sidebar where you'd like to place it
1. In the widget options, set a title for the widget (leave blank for none)
1. Choose a button or image using from the official buttons OR
1. Enter a full URL (http://full.path.to/image) to an alternate button image
1. If you would like to change the width of the button enter the width (in px or ems)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this add a button to the post itself? Can this be added? =

This only adds a widget for you to add to your sidebar. I will investigate making it possible to add to post pages. If you are adventurous, you could try addin the code yourself based on [what I wrote here](http://firstwaves.org/new-wave-this-function-and-buttons/).
